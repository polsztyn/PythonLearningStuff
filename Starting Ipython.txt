Starting the notebook server
You can start running a notebook server from the command line using the following command:

ipython notebook


This will print some information about the notebook server in your console, and open a web browser to the URL 
of the web application (by default, http://127.0.0.1:8888).

The landing page of the IPython notebook web application, the dashboard, shows the notebooks 
currently available in the notebook directory (by default, the directory from which the notebook server was started).

You can create new notebooks from the dashboard with the New Notebook button, or open existing ones 
by clicking on their name. You can also drag and drop .ipynb notebooks and standard .py Python source code files 
into the notebook list area.

When starting a notebook server from the command line, you can also open a particular notebook directly, bypassing 
the dashboard, with ipython notebook my_notebook.ipynb. The .ipynb extension is assumed if no extension is given.

When you are inside an open notebook, the File | Open... menu option will open the dashboard in a new browser tab, 
to allow you to open another notebook from the notebook directory or to create a new notebook.
