    "These assignments will help you learn to invoke social API calls from Python, find effective client wrapper modules, and read social API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This weeks assignments requires disparate software systems to talk together. Many things can go wrong (installation problems, network errors, etc), and the error messages you see may seem confusing. **If you get stuck, please post the forum. We're here to help you!**\n",

    "#Assignment 1: Continuing exploring the GitHub module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** This question will provide you with experience navigating API documentation from a social API such as GitHub, and help you learn to write \"native\" Python code to connect to a social media API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point total:** 10 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time estimate:** 60 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson we learned how to retrieve the recent GitHub changes. Study the GitHub API to write a function called print_commit_messages. The function should output the time and message for the most recent 10 commits by a particular user."
